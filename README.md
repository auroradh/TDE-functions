# 3TDE
Plot 3 point time delay estimation. 
This repository contains functions for extracting data needed to plot a 3 point time delay estimation. It also contains a guide showing how to use the 3 point time delay estimation method and how to plot the resulting velocity field for Alcator C-Mod and W7X.

# Dependencies: 
These plotting functions depend on the following two GitHub repositories:
1. https://github.com/uit-cosmo/velocity-estimation
2. https://github.com/sajidah-ahmed/cmod_functions

# Installation
