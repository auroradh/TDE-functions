# TDE-functions
Plotting 3 point time delay estimation. 

This repository contains functions for extracting data needed to plot a 3 point time delay estimation. It also contains a guide showing how to use the 3 point time delay estimation method and how to plot the resulting velocity field for Alcator C-Mod and W7X.

# Dependencies: 
This repository depends on the following two GitHub repositories:
1. For estimating velocities: https://github.com/uit-cosmo/velocity-estimation
2. For extracting APD data from C-Mod: https://github.com/sajidah-ahmed/cmod_functions
3. For running normalization: https://github.com/uit-cosmo/fpp-analysis-tools 
4. For plotting interface: https://github.com/uit-cosmo/cosmoplots
